## Project Proposal

Our business model is a website that allows students to rate their landlords, similar to Rate My Professor. We can earn money by accepting advertisements from student-related businesses and organizations. Some examples of target advertisers would be: a student campaigning for GM presidency, an RPI sorority looking to recruit students, or a storage facility near Troy. In addition, as the website gets more popular, we can charge landlords a membership fee in order to be part of the website since it would grant them more credibility.

## License

We chose to use the MIT License because of its simplicity and ease of use. While the main function of the app is to help college students find housing, it is a business model because we will be collecting income through different areas. The website could be used to host advertisment targeted towards college students (or RPI students specifically). The features of the website can also be locked behind a pay-wall. Landlords could be charged to list their properties or pay in order to have their properties listed more favorably. With the MIT License we weould be allowed to create this business model despite the project being open-source.
