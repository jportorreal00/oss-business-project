## Project Proposal

Our business model is a website that allows students to rate and find trustworthy landlords, similar to Rate My Professor. We can earn money by accepting advertisements from student-related businesses and organizations. Some examples of target advertisers would be: a student campaigning for GM presidency, an RPI sorority looking to recruit students, or a storage facility near Troy looking for customers. In addition, as the website gets more popular, we can charge landlords a membership fee in order to be part of the website since it would grant them more credibility.

## License

We chose to use the MIT License because of its simplicity and ease of use, which makes it non-intimidating for use by student developers. It doesn't create as many restrictions on the use of the code as opposed to other licenses (like GPL for instance). The MIT License allows others to sublicense or release the software under a propriety license, as long as the original copyright is credited as well. This makes it fitting for an RPI-oriented project, since it facilitates popularizing the code and reaching others who may see greater business potential in it. Overall, using the MIT License we would allow us to create our landlord-rating business model despite the project being open-source.
